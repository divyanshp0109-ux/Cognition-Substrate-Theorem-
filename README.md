## What Is Proved

### 1. Existence Theorem
Formalizes the 6-tuple `⟨S, T, F, ⊕, J, Φ⟩` and proves the existence of a valid Cognitive Substrate using constructive Minimal Types (Unit).

### 2. Minimality Theorems (Necessity)
Proves that **all 6 components** are strictly necessary, using **two proof strategies**:

| Component | Strategy | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporal (T)** | Ablation | `Time = Unit` → Contradiction |
| **State (S)** | Ablation | `State = Empty` → Contradiction |
| **Inference (F)** | Ablation | `Eval = Empty` → Contradiction |
| **Justification (J)** | Ablation | `Token = Empty` → Contradiction |
| **Belief (⊕)** | Ablation | `State = Unit` → Contradiction (Static system cannot learn) |
| **Protocol (Φ)** | Non-Formation | No Protocol Type → System Construction Impossible |

All three formalizations (Lean 4, Coq, Isabelle) prove the same theorems independently.

## Build Instructions

### Lean 4 (Type-Theoretic)
```bash
lake exe cache get   # Download pre-compiled Mathlib binaries
lake build           # Compile and check all proofs
```
Requires `mathlib4`.

### Lean 4 (Coalgebraic — Work in Progress)
See [`coalgebraic formalisation initial formalisation results/README.md`](coalgebraic%20formalisation%20initial%20formalisation%20results/README.md) for full details.
```bash
lake exe cache get
lake env lean "coalgebraic formalisation initial formalisation results/CST_Coalgebraic.lean"
lake env lean "coalgebraic formalisation initial formalisation results/FinalCoalgebra.lean"
```

### Coq/Rocq
```bash
coqc coq/CST.v
coqc coq/CST_Minimality.v
```
Requires [Rocq Platform 9.0](https://github.com/coq/platform/releases). See [`coq/README.md`](coq/README.md) for environment setup.

### Isabelle/HOL
Open `isabelle/CST.thy` and `isabelle/CST_Minimality.thy` in **Isabelle/jEdit** — proofs verify automatically.
